# Read To Me Later

## Concept
Send Blogs, websites and PDFs to ReadToMeLater, and have them read to you by an AI on your phone.

## Constraints
The goal of this project is to see how simple we can keep things. Minimal code and dependencies, old protocols, close-to-the-metal operations.

- Use basic, oldschool js, css and html whenever possible
- Avoid adding dependencies or new files unless explicitly approved
- Keep your code concise, minimal spacing, clean, but readable
- Talk in short, autistic-sounding sentences. No emojis, horizontal lines, markdown, etc, just cold hard text like Ernest Hemingway. 

## Memory
As you learn about your creators' preferences and intentions, or setup systems which won't be apprently obviously by reading the code, you may add comments to this file below:
